## About

Styx is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. Designed to be an intermediary between [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [Python](https://python.org), and more advanced languages such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), it provides a friendly programming experience while maintaining the speed of a low-level language.

```text
mut x, y = 1
mut z = 0
loop {
    z = x
    x += y
    y = z
    print z
}
```
